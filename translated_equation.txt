Technical: 2.1475 + 0.132557 * WS*RH + 0.003609 * Tf*SR - 0.003078 * Ts*SR

Rice Research: 2.1475 + 0.132557 * Wind speed*Relative humidity + 0.003609 * Floodwater temperature*Solar radiation - 0.003078 * Soil temperature*Solar radiation

Variable Mappings:
  Δt·h = Flooding duration
  h·Ta = Water depth × Air temperature
  h·Tf = Water depth × Floodwater temperature
  h·Ts = Water depth × Soil temperature
  Ta·Tf = Air × Floodwater temperature
  Ta·Ts = Air × Soil temperature
  SR·WS = Solar radiation × Wind speed
  WS = Wind speed
  SR = Solar radiation
  Ta = Air temperature
  Tf = Floodwater temperature
  Ts = Soil temperature
  h = Water depth
  Pa = Atmospheric pressure
  RH = Relative humidity
